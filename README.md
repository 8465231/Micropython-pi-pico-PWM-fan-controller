# Micropython-pi-pico-PWM-fan-controller
Pi Pico based PWM fan controller with Tempreture control and pot bias

Basically this is just a place for me to store the code so I can wget it onto the pico without removing it from the server easily using rshell.

Yes, I know the code is ugly and there are better ways of doing it, this is my first time messing with both python or the pico.

I would like to be able to create a curve for the PWM output but have not been able to figure out how.
